\section{CULA}
\label{sec:cula}

CULA is the GPU-based version of LAPACK package. It shows a 3x to 10x
speedup compared to Intel Math Kernel Library implemented for Intel
Core i7 processor. Compared with LAPACK package implementation, it
shows a 40x to 200x speed-up.


There is no need for the user to manage GPU memory or know any
specifics about GPU programming. Simply call a CULA function and the
framework will do all the GPU management for you. The allocations,
workspace creations, and memory transfers are all taken care of under
the hood. 

There are three different versions: CULA Basic, CULA Premium, and CULA
Commercial. Even though CULA Basic is for free, all installers only
provide pre-compiled libraries and the headers needed to develop a
CULA application.

All versions of CULA support single-precision complex
data. Double-precision complex support is included in both CULA
Premium and CULA Commercial. The CULA Basic Beta only supports
single-precision real data. 

CULA functions use column-major data.
