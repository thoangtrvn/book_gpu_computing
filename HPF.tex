\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction-2}


High Performance Fortran is an extension to Fortran language that
supports parallel computing. It allows user to insert directives into
Fortran 90 codes which specify the distribution of data among the
processors. Currently, most HPF products are source translator, rather
than a true compiler. In other words, HPF products translate the
sources with HPF directives into the source, which calls to PVM or
MPI, that can be read by a compiler without native HPF capability.

It provides some new constructs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item new Fortran statements: FORALL
\item create PURE (side effect free) procedures
\item compiler directives for recommended distribution of array data
\item additional libraries
\end{enumerate}

The runtime performance of HPF codes vary from vendor to vendor.
